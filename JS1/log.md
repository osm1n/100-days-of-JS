## Day 1 - 18th June 2020
Todays Progress: How JS and HTML integrates, Two ways to run JS code either using node on a terminal or using <script> tags within HTML code on a web browser. Using document.querySelector function to identify elements.

Thoughts: Learned about some basic html tags and running JS scirpt within a web browser. Nothing really challenging today, feeling confident and relaxed.  Although document.querySelector seems a little confusing, I am not sure what is the purpose of this function. More reading required on that!

## Day 2 - 19th June 2020
Todays Progress: More on document.querySelector, Element properties (onClick and Value). Onclick runs a function once a button is clicked. Value gets or manipuates the value entered as input. A function can be created to perform manipulation on entered values.

Thoughts: After several examples, i got the concept of document.querySelector when it is in use with onclick or value properties, basically used to obtain or identify elements (buttons, textbox etc). Cool concept is changing or setting input value taken from the user. Good for scripting attacks i guess. Tomorrow is all Exercises. Am excited.

## Day 3 - 20th June 2020
Todays Progress: No new topics, just practised questions on Yesterdays topic. The exercises are to implement the challenges from JS0 as html files.

Thoughts: Creating a funtion in a function is a little challenging but after going through steps by steps and repetition, the concepts might be clear. So far So good. 

## Day 4 - 21st June 2020
Todays Progress: Learned about Closure which means a concept that allows a fucntion to keep track of variables and parameters for future use. It formally defined as > An inner function always has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.. Revisited Execution Context to practice stpes by steps JS code execution. 

Thoughts: Understood Closure after practising with a few examples

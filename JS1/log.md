## Day 1 - 18th June 2020
Todays Progress: How JS and HTML integrates, Two ways to run JS code either using node on a terminal or using <script> tags within HTML code on a web browser. Using document.querySelector function to identify elements.

Thoughts: Learned about some basic html tags and running JS scirpt within a web browser. Nothing really challenging today, feeling confident and relaxed.  Although document.querySelector seems a little confusing, I am not sure what is the purpose of this function. More reading required on that!

## Day 2 - 19th June 2020
Todays Progress: More on document.querySelector, Element properties (onClick and Value). Onclick runs a function once a button is clicked. Value gets or manipuates the value entered as input. A function can be created to perform manipulation on entered values.

Thoughts: After several examples, i got the concept of document.querySelector when it is in use with onclick or value properties, basically used to obtain or identify elements (buttons, textbox etc). Cool concept is changing or setting input value taken from the user. Good for scripting attacks i guess. Tomorrow is all Exercises. Am excited.

## Day 3 - 20th June 2020
Todays Progress: No new topics, just practised questions on Yesterdays topic. The exercises are to implement the challenges from JS0 as html files.

Thoughts: Creating a funtion in a function is a little challenging but after going through steps by steps and repetition, the concepts might be clear. So far So good. 

## Day 4 - 21st June 2020
Todays Progress: Learned about Closure which means a concept that allows a fucntion to keep track of variables and parameters for future use. It formally defined as > An inner function always has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.. Revisited Execution Context to practice stpes by steps JS code execution. 

Thoughts: Understood Closure after practising with a few examples. The exercises are confusing since there is no more step by step explanations. Need to figure out the questions base on the examples. I will have to revist these exercises tomorrow

## Day 5 - 22nd June 2020
Todays Progress: revisited exercises from yesterday and thank goodness the concepts are clear and somewhat easy to implement. Learned about implementing addLog instead of adding console.log() to every function. Adding Default Parameters to functions, when the function is called with a single parameter, the parameter is assigned starting from the left hand side to the right.  Recursion - a function that only needs to call itself.

Thoughts: Default parameters is a familiar topic to me, so that was a breeze. Recursion is also straightforward but need a little more practice. So far so good. A few challenges and topics that needs revisiting. 

## Day 6 - 23rd June 2020
Daddy's day out with the baby.

## Day 7 - 24th une 2020
Todays Progress: More on recursion - Steps to writing a recursive function  - 1. Figure out the variables needed, add them to the function as parameters with default values if needed. 2. A condition (base) to stop and exit the function. 3 - Recursive case - write the logic for the iteration. Learned only Recursion today and Exercises

Thoughts:

<b>Day 0 - Wed 17th June 2020 - Foundations of JS</b>

I have already completed the foundations of Javascript, which is JS 0 found here [JS 0 Foundations](https://www.notion.so/JS-0-Foundations-a43ca620e54945b2b620bcda5f3cf672).  This stage is more of a couple of days tasks in summary.
- It introduces the concepts of creating Variables, Primitive Data, Arrow Function, Condtional Statement and lots of Exercises to work on.
- An insteresting way of looking at Truthy and Falsey in relation to && and || operators.
- Took about 2 days to complete the JS0 challenges (10 in total) due to submission mistakes on my part using git
